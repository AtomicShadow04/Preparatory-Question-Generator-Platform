    "originalContent": "Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,\n\nI am pleased to write on behalf of Mr. Oluwafunbi Abubakar's application to enter your university. I had the privilege of being his supervisor for his final-year project at Babcock University, and in so doing, I witnessed both his technical ability and his unwavering determination to create things that matter.\n\n\n\nOluwafunbi is not only a diligent student; he is also an inventor with great determination. For his project at the end of his final year, he and his team designed an AI-Powered Vacation Itinerary Generator Platform — a platform that uses artificial intelligence to personalize travel arrangements according to users' requirements and constraints. This project was not only technically demanding but also socially relevant, reflecting Oluwafunbi’s ability to combine creativity, technical depth, and real-world application. His persistence, critical thinking, and ability to guide his team through challenges were particularly impressive.\nWhat truly distinguishes him is his synergy of intellectual curiosity and team player mentality. He is often the one who ensures no team member is left behind, educating peers as he pushes for perfection. His leadership stems from empathy and integrity — characteristics which render him respected by peers and irreplaceable in any group dynamic.\n\n\n\nI do not doubt that Oluwafunbi will bring the same energy, curiosity, and persistence to your university community as he has brought to Babcock. He is a student who not only excels on his own but inspires others to excel and be their best selves — a quality that will allow him to make a lasting impact in your academic community.\n\n\n\nI highly recommend him. You can reach me at +234 806 940 4730 or somefuno@babcock.edu.ng  if you would like more information about his qualifications.\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\n\n\nEngineer Olawale Somefun",
